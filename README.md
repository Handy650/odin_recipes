This is my first project using the language HTML, it's about
different recipes that I personally enjoy.
The skills that I'll be using in this project are

#### -HTML
#### -The terminal
#### -Etiquetes 
#### -Attributes
#### -Git
#### -GitHub

I have been learing these skills with odin project
and now I'm prepared and excited to create my first project.

I just finished my whole project was not easy, that is obvious
since I am a beginner but the good thing is that I feel confident now to 
create new projects, I am prepared for next topic which is css, really excited.
The experience was really good, I definetly created experience with this project.
