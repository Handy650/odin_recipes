<h1><center>LASAGNA <img src="../images/lasagnaani.png" width="26" height="24"> </center></h1>    
<p>A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but this special recipe 
    calls for a blend of <strong>small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.</strong> I have found none better anywhere. 
    Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread and you will really enjoy it.</p>
